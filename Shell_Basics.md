# Basics

* Types of Shells - 
   - Bash/Bourne Again Shell: This is the most common shell available on all Linux and based systems. It is open source and freeware.
   - CSH or C Shell: This Shell scripting program uses the C programming’s shell syntax and it’s almost similar to C.
   - KSH or Korn Shell: Korn is a Unix based Shell scripting program, initially based on the Bash Shell Scripting. This shell is quite advanced and it’s a high level programming language.
   - TCSH: There is no specific full form of TCSH. It is as it is. TCSH is an advanced version of Berkeley Unix C shell. It again supports C style syntax.

* Shebang line - Shebang line at the top of each script determines the location of the engine which is to be used in order to execute the script.
   #!/bin/sh or #!/bin/bash at the beginning of every script tells which shell to use. 
   - Interactive shell - /bin/bash and /bin/sh  
   - Non-interactive shell - /sbin/nologin shell

* CronTab: Crontab stands for cron table because it uses the job scheduler cron to execute tasks. The crontab is a list of commands that you want to run on a regular schedule, and also the name of the command used to manage that list. 
The five fields contain information on when to execute the command .

minute(0-59)
hour(0-23)
day(1-31) 
month(1-12)
day of the week(0-6, Sunday = 0).
